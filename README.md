# React Tailwind Currency Converter

This simple currency converter app was built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project was created as part of my learning journey with Tailwind CSS and aims to provide a modern, responsive interface for currency conversion.

## Features

- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Fetches live currency rates for accurate conversions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalistic design using Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience.
- **Customizable Options**: Users can select base and target currencies and input the amount to convert.
- **Responsive Design**: Works with a clean, adaptive layout across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **API Integration**: Fetching real-time currency exchange rates (e.g., from a public API like [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)).

## Usage

1. Select the base currency and target currency from the dropdown menus.
2. Enter the amount to be converted.
3. View the converted amount in real time.
