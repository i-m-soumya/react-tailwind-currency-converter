# React Tailwind Currency Converter

This is a simple currency converter app built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project was created as part of my learning journey with Tailwind CSS and aims to provide a modern, responsive interface for currency conversion.

## Features

- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Fetches live currency rates for accurate conversions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalistic design using Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience.
- **Customizable Options**: Allows users to select base and target currencies and input the amount to convert.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all devices with a clean, adaptive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **API Integration**: Fetching real-time currency exchange rates (e.g., from a public API like [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)).
